- 👋 Hi, I’m @AzulCerulean
- 👀 I’m interested in Games and Coding
- 🌱 Recent graduate, full stack web developer
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything funsies

Full-stack web developer and recent graduate from Concordia looking to put my skills to use in building and designing apps. I have experience with JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, express.js, and MongoDB. I have also demonstrated my ability to learn and adapt in a fast paced environment in both the classroom and previous career in Information Technology (IT).

In my free time I love playing video games, mostly RPGs. I love when they feature great writing and choices that affect the state of the game or series eg. Mass Effect and Dragon Age. I would love to be involved in game development someday.
