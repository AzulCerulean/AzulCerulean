  I'm Azul, a recent graduate in full stack web development (MERN Stack) from Concordia University 
Bootcamps. I am very adaptable and learn what I need to know fast.

  I previously worked 5 years in the IT (Information Technology) field of Service Desk where I would assist 
many user types, including developers. This experience gave me some insight into the field of software 
engineering.
  During my career break, I decided it was time to take a step towards development, and 
sure enough I found it to be exciting and fun.
  
  During my downtime, my hobbies include gaming (video games and tabletop), music, learning of new 
hobbies and imagining new fantastical worlds.
